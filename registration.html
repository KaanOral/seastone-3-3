            <h2>About Coast and Crest</h2>
            <p class="enroll__para"> We've mad the decision to <br> <strong class="bold">TRANSITION OUR GATHERINGS AND CAMPOUTS TO A PRIVATE MEMBERSHIP STRUCTURE.</strong> <br>
              <br>
              We've created the Coast & Crest Cahoots club, a private membership group, as the container through which we will offer camps such as The Sea Stone Family Gathering and Clam Camp, as well as other various camps and group activities we may develop along the way. Moving forward, these offerings will be private, members only events. Transitioning to this organizing structure offers us several benefits, which we've decided are well worth the ask of you to sign up as private members. We recognize that not all will resonate with this model, but trust that those who do will take this leap with us. <br>
              <br>
              First and foremost, enrolling as a private member allows us to electronically collect your camp waivers, eliminating the need to print excessive amounts of paper, or running around to track you down during camp so you can sign your waivers. To be able to continue offering these containers of gathering, learning, and communing, our family's well being must be ensured, hence the prioritization of ensured collected waivers from all participating individuals. <br>
              <br>
              Additionally, the creation of a private membership as the vehicle through which we offer our camps will allow us to maintain the familiarity and intimacy of the camp culture we've worked hard to establish and aim to continue to nourish. <br>
              <br>
              Most notedly, by tranisitioning to offering private, members only events, we can avoid many of the additional costs and labor associated with public ticketed events. <br>
              Keeping our registration amounts affordable and our camp logistics manageable for our small crew. <br>
              <br>
              This transition is good for us, good for you, for our camp kiddos, and for our long term gathering endeavors. <br>
              <br>
              <strong class="bold" >Private membership Dues</strong> <br>
              Yes, to be legit, membership dues are required. <br>
              but hey, lifetime membership is only $5bucks per cohabitating family. <br>
              Your membership enrollment and dues cover yourself and one additional adult of your immediate family, plus your child(ren) <br>
              Not so bad, eh? And I did try to have a bit o' fun with our club name :) <br>
              <br>
              <strong class="bold" >In summary, moving forward, all attending + participating members of camp must be an enrolled private member. <br>
              This includes teachers, students, performers, crew members, work traders, children... everyone. </strong>
